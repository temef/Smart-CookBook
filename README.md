# Smart-CookBook

Smart-CookBook is a Scala-based application designed to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for managing and viewing various recipes. Utilizing Scala Swing, this project offers graphical user interface, making the navigation and interaction with recipes seamless. This is my first own project from 2020 when I started my Computer Science studies.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or higher
- Scala Build Tool (sbt), which also covers Scala and Scala Swing dependencies

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. To compile the project, run: ```sbt compile```

## Running the Application

To run Smart-CookBook, follow these steps:

1. Open the project's root directory.

2. Navigate to the project's directory `src/main/scala`.

3. Run the following file `SmartCookBook GUI.scala`:
   
4. The GUI should now launch, allowing you to interact with the application.

## Project Structure

- `src/main/scala`: Contains the Scala source files.
- `SmartCookBook GUI.scala`: The main GUI application file.

- `Documents`: This folder contains the Project Document, Technical Plan, and Project Plan.
